  # Movie Recommender System

This project is a movie recommender system implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. It uses item-based collaborative filtering to recommend movies to users. The implementation leverages the power of `Pandas`, `Numpy`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn` libraries for data manipulation, numerical operations, and visualization.

## Features

- **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:** The recommendation algorithm finds similarities between items (movies) and suggests movies based on these similarities.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilizes Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize data distributions, movie ratings, and recommendation patterns.
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook:** The project is implemented in an interactive Jupyter Notebook environment, making it easy to understand and extend.



## following libraries were used 

- `Pandas`
- `Numpy`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Seaborn`
-
  ## Built over `Jupyter Notebook`

## Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

Compute similarity between movies using cosine similarity.
Generate movie recommendations based on item similarity.
